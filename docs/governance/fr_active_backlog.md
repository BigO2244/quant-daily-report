# FR Active Backlog

## Purpose

This document is the operator-readable roadmap for active Caerus Friday
Refactor (FR) work. It contains only work that is not fully closed:

- `BACKLOG`
- `READY`
- `READY_VALIDATED`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `PROMOTION_READY`
- `DEPLOYED_OBSERVING`

Fully deployed history and reviewed deferred items belong in
`docs/governance/fr_registry.md`. Governance methodology belongs in
`docs/governance/fr_governance_model.md`.

## Current Active Summary

| FR | Phase | Status | Blast Radius | Dependencies | Observation Status | Current State | Rollback Reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-001 shadow wrapper decomposition | Wave 2 | `DEPLOYED_OBSERVING` | MEDIUM | Wave 2 deployment | observing | Shadow remains non-blocking and writes step status artifacts. | Revert wrapper decomposition commit. |
| FR-002 price cache coverage sidecar | Data / Hydration | `DEPLOYED_OBSERVING` | LOW | Hydration artifact ownership review | observing | Read-only coverage sidecar preview diagnostic added; parquet remains canonical and unmodified. | Stop running `scripts.research.check_price_cache_coverage`; inspect parquet directly. |
| FR-005 self-heal recovery integrity | Wave 3 | `DEPLOYED_OBSERVING` | HIGH | Wave 3 deployment | observing | Execution continues only after full bundle validation. | Revert FR-005 commit; preserve recovery artifacts. |
| FR-012 CI cache namespace isolation | Wave 2 | `DEPLOYED_OBSERVING` | MEDIUM | Wave 2 deployment | observing | Cache keys include `github.repository_id`. | Revert cache namespace commit. |
| FR-014 shadow learning reliability | Shadow / Learning | `DEPLOYED_OBSERVING` | LOW | FR-015 and FR-017 preferred | observing | Read-only learning-health diagnostic added; learning logic and artifacts unchanged. | Stop running `scripts.research.check_shadow_learning_health`; ignore diagnostic output. |
| FR-016 semantic precompute contract validation | Phase 4 | `READY` | MEDIUM | FR-015 | spec_documented | Advisory validation scope documented; no code or execution gates implemented. | Leave current bundle validation unchanged. |
| FR-021 partial execution state normalization | Phase 4 | `BACKLOG` | HIGH | FR-015, FR-017 | not_started | Execution-adjacent semantic work; defer until lower-risk telemetry is established. | Leave current partial-failure interpretation unchanged. |
| FR-028 shadow execution timing semantics correction candidate | Accounting Correctness | `BACKLOG` | HIGH | FR-024, FR-025, FR-026, FR-027, FR-030 | not_started | FR-governed candidate for prior-day weights against next-session returns; no historical migration. | Keep current published chain unchanged; disable candidate comparison reader. |
| FR-029 promotion governance hardening for provenance, exposure, and timing confidence | Promotion Governance | `BACKLOG` | MEDIUM | FR-028 | not_started | Future promotion gates should consume provenance, exposure, and timing confidence after accounting semantics are governed. | Revert promotion-readiness checks to existing scorecard criteria. |

Recently closed Phase 4 work now lives in `docs/governance/fr_registry.md`:
FR-015, FR-017, FR-018, FR-023, FR-024, FR-025, FR-026, FR-027, and FR-030
are deployed/current. FR-019 and FR-020 are also deployed as docs-only
retention, backup, and validation isolation policies. These remain additive
telemetry, provenance, governance, and research interpretation infrastructure,
not execution, promotion, accounting, or timing semantic changes.

## Phase 4 Priority Order

Phase 4 focuses on artifact governance and operational telemetry. It is
non-trading, non-execution, additive, and low blast radius by default.

| Order | FR | Why This Order |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | FR-015 | Establishes artifact ownership, taxonomy, and registry semantics before downstream telemetry depends on artifact interpretation. |
| 2 | FR-017 | Gives operators a single health synthesis surface while staying read-only and additive. |
| 3 | FR-018 | Reduces stale `latest` ambiguity after ownership semantics are clear. |
| 4 | FR-023 | Separates canonical docs from generated reports before more operational docs accumulate. |
| 5 | FR-019 | Deployed docs-only policy for cleanup, archive, evidence hold, and backup rules; no cleanup automation. |
| 6 | FR-020 | Deployed docs-only policy for bounded validation output and test/smoke isolation; code-level migration remains future work. |
| 7 | FR-016 | Adds deeper semantic checks after artifact ownership and freshness semantics exist. |
| 8 | FR-021 | Important but execution-adjacent; defer until telemetry and state language are stable. |
| 9 | FR-024 | Establishes explicit performance provenance before additional research metrics are surfaced. |
| 10 | FR-025 | Daily immutable holdings history depends on surface ownership and becomes the base for realized attribution. |
| 11 | FR-026 | Exposure intelligence can then consume stable holdings and provenance. |
| 12 | FR-027 | Regime fragility is more interpretable after exposure and concentration are visible. |
| 13 | FR-030 | Daily packet consumes existing telemetry without changing execution, accounting, timing, dashboard, or promotion behavior. |
| 14 | FR-028 | Accounting semantics are high blast-radius and must wait for provenance, history, observability, and packet interpretation baselines. |
| 15 | FR-029 | Promotion hardening should follow timing semantics review so gates do not encode unstable accounting assumptions. |

FR-022 remains `REVIEWED_DEFERRED` in the registry. Hash enforcement should not
be promoted until dependency baselines, clean installs, and emergency update
procedures are proven.

## Immediate Focus

1. Keep FR-028 and FR-029 in Friday-governed Track B until before/after
   comparison artifacts, rollback plans, and observation criteria are reviewed.
2. Treat FR-030 as deployed telemetry consumption, not promotion logic.
3. Focus the next research-operations bottleneck on post-close hydration and
   source readiness, not packet rendering.
4. Continue to separate MCP planning from FR-028 accounting/timing work.
5. Use FR-015/017/018/023-027/030 outputs as inputs to future attribution,
   source-readiness, and governance reviews without changing execution paths.

## Roadmap Boundaries

Do not use Phase 4 as a vehicle for microservices, Kubernetes, Airflow, broad
scheduler rewrites, strategy promotion, broker changes, or cron timing changes.
The current bottleneck is operational clarity, not distributed compute scale.
